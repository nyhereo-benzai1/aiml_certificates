# ðŸ§  AI & Machine Learning Certifications â€“ Nyx (Payal Choudhary)

Welcome to my AI/ML learning journey!

This repository documents the certifications Iâ€™m currently pursuing from world-renowned institutions like **DeepLearning.AI**, **Coursera**, and **IBM**, along with the **projects** and **code implementations** Iâ€™m building alongside them.
